THE PRINCIPLES:
	LONG-TERM LEARNING VS WINNING THE SYSTEM:
		http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html

	WHAT IS SUCCESS ?
		everybody has a different idea/meaning of success
		being an efficient learner, being smart is great
			but you need the drive and persistence to really succeed, 
				you need to work hard for what you want 
					and the easy route is taken by those with no drive and persistence
		to succeed you will need to take risks and make mistakes, 
			you have to do the unconventional
		those who succeed are the ones 
			who take the path less traveled 
				and who have a DRIVE and PERSISTANCE

	THE OBSTACLE: Enjoy Obstacle -> Keep driving and persist
	
	THE DIP:
		push enough to overcome obstacles but also known when the dip is here, when to turn around
		"The Dip" by Seth Godin
	
	COMPOUND LEARNING:
		inspired by compound interest
			"Improve by 1% a day, and in 70 days you're twice as good." - Alan Weiss
				the small changes that we make each day have compounding effects later on in our lives
	
	FAILURES DON'T COUNT: 
		your failures don't count against you
		you can fail hundred thousand millions of times, all that matters is where we're at our current state
			the more failures we have, the more feedback we're going to get to improve

	CHOICE VS CHORE: it must be, it's a choice not a chore to do something, learning must be a choice

	IT'S ALL IN THE FRAME:
		frames/contexts are what humans use to change perspectives
		the idea of framing is all about 
			moving from a beginner attitude into a beginner mindset,
			having a beginner mindset instead of a beginner attitude
		the aim of all these principles is to shift your focus/perspectives 
			into what you can control instead of what you have no control over

	PARETO PRINCIPLE (the 80/20 rule, the law of vital few):
		 states that, for many events, 80% of the effects/results come from 20% of the causes

	SKILL STACKING:
		in "Mastery" by Robert Greene, 
			he mentionned that there's 3 approaches when it comes to career strategy:
				curiosity, (value learning above high salary) and skill stacking
		the key with skill stacking is to have skills that work well together 
			but are also enough varied to make you stand up
		by example a programmer with communication/business skills 
			is more valuable that just a simple really good programmer

	HAPPINESS FACTORS:
		happiness improves learning
			example: work, good friend group/family, learning, sport

	YOUR PRODUCTIVITY TIME:
		find your productivity time and give yourself the permission to study when you feel the best

	SELF LEARNING PARADIGM: it's all about having intrinsic motivation


THE LIES:
	Follow your passion:
		"SO GOOD THEY CAN'T IGNORE YOU", Cal Newport
			in this amazing book Carl advices that passion is simply overatted
				just because you like doing something
					doesn't mean it's what your work career needs to be 
		
		on the contrary, it's by learning valuable skill, getting better and better at something,
			getting smarter, getting more and more recognition, 
				having more people that recognize you as an expert
		it's that act of self-improvment and self-recognition, 
			it's what actually makes you enjoy your job, your skills, your career

		so you don't need passion, passion can comes after by being master in your path
			what you need is creativity, control and impact in your path

		the craftsman mindset says:
			instead of just following your passion, finding that perfect job, 
				instead, work hard, be humble, learn valuable skill, 
					combine different skills and get really really good, 
						SO GOOD THAT THEY CAN'T IGNORE YOU 

	You Can Avoid Risk:
		successful person can't avoid risk 
			(stress/obstacles/.. are unavoidable)
				risks are challenges to look foward to

	Trust This One Person:
		no, on the contrary, the good thing to do is to form your own opinion that is unique to you based on multiple sources of information

	10,000 Hours Rule:
		no, on the contrary, it's all about learning efficiently versus learning hard


THE PILLARS:
	EVERYTHING IS A GAME:
		everything is a game, 
			like a character in a game, we evolve, we fail, 
				and we re-try over and over until successful
		
		growth mindset vs fixed mindset: 'Mindset' Carol Dweck
			growth mindset is the belief that intelligence can be developed, everything is trainable
				a person with growth mindset faces obstacles, faces challenges
		
		(control over life: internal locus of control) vs (external locus of control)
		 	locus of control is a psychology term 
		 		that means what degree people believe that they have control over outcomes and events

		 	people that have a strong locus, else called internal locus 
		 		believe that they have a lot of control over their lives, 
		 			believe that events in their lives derive from their own actions
		 	somebody who have a low locus, else called external locus 
		 		tend to blame factors outside of themselves

		 AN EFFICIENT LEARNER HAS A GROWTH MINDSET (our brain adapt) AND INTERNAL LOCUS

	FEYNMAN TECHNIQUE:
		named after Richard Feynman, a famous physist nobel prize
			who was not only renomwned for being extremely smart
				but also for his ability to explain things to beginners

		so the Feynman Technique says that if you really want to understand something, know a topic
			you need to be able to teach it, explain it in a simple manner

	TRUNK BASED KNOWLEDGE:
		the trunk based knowledge is this idea that in order for us to be efficient learners
			we must first start to learn by consolidating the fundamentals (the roots) 
				before getting to the leafs (the trends, the details)

	Efficiency Trumps Grit:
		efficient learning isn't about being the absolute hardest worker
			it's about being smart with your time, using the right methods (the right strategies)
